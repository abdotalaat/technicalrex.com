Last week I signed a coworking agreement at the [NEO Center](http://www.neocenter.org) in Lansing, Michigan!

The picture above is the top floor of the NEO Center. It was -8 degrees Fahrenheit so my apologies for not taking a picture of the outside!

This is my chance to stop sitting around the house working on small pet projects (mixed in with random chores that have nothing to do with my business goals!) and actually do something meaningful. I am hoping to meet other people and businesses that are part of Lansing's [impressive startup scene](http://lansingstartchart.herokuapp.com).

There is a lot of positive energy and movement going on here and I want to be a part of it!
