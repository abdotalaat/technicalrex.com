Just a quick heads-up, the site will be getting a facelift over the next few weeks!

As part of my effort to learn about [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Liquid](https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics), and graphics/web design, I'll be revamping the site while trying to make sure none of the links break.

Right now the site is hosted using [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) and it costs money while not giving me much control. I want to get both of those things back and hone my Web Fu skills.

I've already done the same for my [family blog](http://gillespieproject.com). The T. Rex blog should go even smoother because I've already written all articles in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) so they're very portable.

I won't switch the domain over till the transition is complete so please keep coming back here for updates. I'll post a temporary URL once I get some basic content out there in case anyone is interested in seeing T. Rex's transformation.

Stay tuned!
