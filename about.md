Technical Rex is a one-person tech company started in late 2007 by me, Erik Gillespie (I'm the one person). I operate this business in and around Lansing, Michigan and at various locations on the Internet. I created Technical Rex as a way to help local businesses develop software but that's changing now. Why help a few when you can just as easily help many?

There are two goals that I try to keep in mind when operating my business:

1. Share as much as possible.
2. Make ideas become reality.

They are short and sweet, yet I feel they have a lot of depth as well.

The Internet would not exist without sharing. Heck, neither would society! Could you imagine how difficult life would be if the steps to create a fire had never been shared with anyone else? This idea is fundamental to our evolution as humans and so I make it fundamental to the operation of my life and business.

I can't nail down a specific time but at some point in my life I was hit with *Creativity and Passion*™. I started having ideas and this overwhelming desire to see them through. The more I try out my ideas (for better or for worse), the more I want to keep trying new ideas out. There's something deeply fulfilling about seeing an idea through and when sharing is introduced into the mix, that satisfaction becomes exponentially greater.

So... that's my business in a nutshell.
